# vikings

Vikings is a 4X (Explore, Expand, Exploit, Exterminate) strategy game modeled after the 1994 game Sid Meier's Colonization. The player leads a Viking exploration party discovering a new landmass, hoping to pillage and plunder, instead having to band together to survive. Here, all the beasts from their mythology walk the earth - and they are out to get them.

Vikings is being written in Python using the multi-media library pyglet (www.pyglet.org).
